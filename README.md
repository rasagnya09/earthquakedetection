# earthquakedetection
This project is an earthquake early warning system that uses machine learning to detect and notify users of significant seismic events in their regions. Built as a web application, it provides real-time earthquake data, visualizations, and alerts, helping users stay informed and take timely action.

Technologies Used
Machine Learning Algorithms:
Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models are implemented to classify and predict seismic activity based on features like earthquake magnitude, location, and depth.

Flask Web Framework:
The application is built using Flask, a Python web framework, for handling routes, managing user sessions, and integrating the backend with the front end.

MySQL Database:
MySQL is used to store user credentials and manage login sessions, providing secure user authentication and profile management.

Frontend (HTML, CSS):
The front-end interface is designed using HTML and CSS to create a user-friendly experience, making it easy to navigate, log in, view earthquake alerts, and access data.

The main application logic and backend code reside in newapp.py file, where the core functionalities are implemented and integrated with the Flask framework.
